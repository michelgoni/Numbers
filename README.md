**Hi 👋**

First things first: Thanks for taking your time rading this Read me.

This a simple iOS app made with SwiftUI wich shows some random facts about numbers using some of the latests features of the Swift language (in not particular order):

* **Combine**
* **Async / await**
* **Dependency injection**
* **Unit testing in each feature layer**

Did I mention **SwiftUI**? 😁

Using a MVVM archtitecture, I´ve followed clean Architecture principles:

Each layer has its own test implementation 🤟

### TODO
- [x] Use SPM as depdendency manager
- [ ] UI testing
- [x] Viewmodel testing
- [x] Modularization
- [x] Use SPM as depdendency manager
- [ ] Use [Soucery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) in order to generate automatically mocks. 


Thanks for reading
