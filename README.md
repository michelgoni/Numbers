**Hi ðŸ‘‹**

First things first: Thanks for taking your time reading this ***Read me***.

This a simple iOS app made with **SwiftUI** wich shows some random facts about numbers using some of the latests features of the Swift language (in not particular order):

* **Combine**
* **Async / await**
* **Dependency injection**
* **Unit testing for each feature layer**


Using a MVVM archtitecture, IÂ´ve followed clean Architecture principles:

Each layer has its own test implementation ðŸ¤Ÿ

### TODO
- [x] Use SPM as depdendency manager
- [ ] UI testing
- [x] Viewmodel testing
- [x] Modularization
- [x] Use SPM as depdendency manager
- [x] Use [Soucery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) in order to generate automatically mocks. 
- [x] Use [Inject](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Inject) in order to see previews automatically since in SwiftUI previews are broken as soon as we handle some custom dependency injection. 


Thanks for reading!
